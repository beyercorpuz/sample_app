# Ruby on Rails Tutorial sample application

This is the sample application for
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial:
Learn Web Development with Rails*](https://www.railstutorial.org/)
(6th Edition)
by [Michael Hartl](https://www.michaelhartl.com/).

All source code in the [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/)

[LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for details.

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ gem install bundler -v 2.2.17
$ bundle _2.2.17_ config set --local without 'production'
$ bundle _2.2.17_ install
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```

For more information, see the
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial* book](https://www.railstutorial.org/book).
Then commit the changes as follows:

$ git commit -am "Improve the README"
You may recall from Section 1.3.4 that we used the Git command git commit -a -m "Message", with flags for “all changes” (-a) and a message (-m). As shown in the second command above, Git also lets us roll the two flags into one using git commit -am "Message".
